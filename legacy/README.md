# Legacy dotfiles

These are old dotfiles that I haven't touched in a very long time.

Examples:
* Micro (editor) dotfiles, which is a text editor I haven't touched in a while.
* My Ruby/RVM stuff, because I use Nix for per-environment settings instead of RVM.
* My NodeJS stuff, because it's empty but I didn't feel like deleting it.
