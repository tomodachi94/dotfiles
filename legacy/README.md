# Legacy dotfiles

These are old dotfiles that I haven't touched in a very long time. I might occasionally add things here while I clean up my home directory.

Examples:
* Micro (editor) dotfiles, which is a text editor I haven't touched in a while.
* My Ruby/RVM stuff, because I use Nix for per-environment settings instead of RVM.
* My NodeJS stuff, because it's empty but I didn't feel like deleting it.
* My Synaptic config, because I use NixOS, not a dpkg-based system.
