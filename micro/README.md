# `micro` configuration

This is my configuration for the Micro text editor. It's not much, but it's something.

## What the hell is this folder structure?

Relax, it'll make sense.

The folder you're in right now (`/micro`) gets symlinked to `~/.config/micro`. This way, my settings and plugins get synced effortlessly.

## What's up with the `plugins` folder?

The plugins for the text editor are just Git submodules. (Since I use submodules elsewhere in this repository, they get pulled automatically without needing to manually add the files.)
